For me, writing is slow and painful.  Writing this introduction is slow
and excruciating.  With a commitment to produce a thesis of 15,000 -
20,000 words before the end of the year I really need writing to be not
slow and would rather prefer that it were not painful.  I need practice.

20,000 words in 40 weeks is 500 words per week.  Let's be conservative
and double it to 1,000 words per week.  If I stick to that plan I will
have a sizeable down-payment on the final thesis.

But the main purpose of this blog is simply regular writing practice: to
develop fluency.  Most articles will be about the thesis topic, but I've
been intending for some time to start writing about some personal and
professional development insights so there will be some words about
those too.

Although not the primary objective, I would hope that a secondary
benefit of this exercise is that the quality of my writing will improve
generally.  I aspire to writing that is clear, concise, unpretentious,
yet with a touch of flair.  In that order.
